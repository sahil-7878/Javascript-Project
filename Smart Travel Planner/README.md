# Smart Travel Planner

## Problem Definition

This project aims to solve a specific programming problem (please clarify or update this section with your exact problem statement). It uses JavaScript and HTML to provide an interactive, browser-based solution. The functionality and user interface are implemented in `index.html` and `script.js` files, respectively.

## Step-wise Explanation

1. **HTML Structure**
    - The `index.html` file defines the structure and layout of the user interface.
    - Elements such as buttons, inputs, and result display areas are included to facilitate user interaction.
2. **JavaScript Logic**
    - The `script.js` file handles all core computations, DOM manipulations, and user interactions.
    - Event listeners are attached to UI elements to trigger the required logic when a user performs actions.
    - The script processes input, performs calculations, and displays results dynamically within the HTML page.
3. **User Interaction**
    - The user enters data or interacts with UI elements.
    - The program responds in real-time, displaying outputs or feedback.
